<meta name="description" content="One of the things I love about natural systems is how complex behavior can arise from sets of simple rules. In biology you see this fairly often, for example Lotka-Volterra equations predict predator-prey interactions and can lead to very complex outcomes despite being incredibly simple. A famous example from the history of computer science is John Conway’s Game of Life which produces incredibly complex (and sometimes unpredictable) interactions between cellular automata from only four rules. A lesser known example are Boids, or bird-oid objects, which demonstrate how three principles, separation, alignment, and cohesion can explain how flocking behavior can arise despite decentralized control. I implemented my own version of the Boids algorithm in Typescript using the HTML5 Canvas element to demonstrate flocking behavior, as well as a demo you can play with to see how the various elements affect flocking behavior." />
