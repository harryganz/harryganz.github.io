<meta name="description" content="Every time I compulsively check house prices near me I feel like I am picking at a scab. Everything just seems so crazy expensive it is hard to believe that things have ever been so bad, but is that actually true. It is hard to argue that house prices are higher now, even adjusted for inflation, than they have ever been, and interest rates are still quite high (in early 2024) relative to the past 30 years or so. However, I can’t quite shake the feeling that perhaps what we are really seeing is a return to how housing was earlier in the century. How can we know? I have looked through historic data on house prices, wages, interest rates, and house features to get to the bottom of this question. Are houses really more expensive than they have ever been or were the last couple decades an anomaly of especially low housing prices?" />

<p>The first graph any Millenial will show to demonstrate how screwed we are when it comes to housing is the ratio of median home price to median household income.</p>
