title: Are Houses Actually More Expensive?
---

Every time I compulsively check house prices near me I feel like I am picking at a scab. Everything just seems so crazy expensive it is hard to believe that things have ever been so bad, but is that actually true. It is hard to argue that house prices are higher now, even adjusted for inflation, than they have ever been, and interest rates are still quite high (in early 2024) relative to the past 30 years or so. However, I can't quite shake the feeling that perhaps what we are really seeing is a return to how housing was earlier in the century. How can we know? I have looked through historic data on house prices, wages, interest rates, and house features to get to the bottom of this question. Are houses really more expensive than they have ever been or were the last couple decades an anomaly of especially low housing prices?

### House Prices vs. Median Income

The first graph any Millenial will show to demonstrate how screwed we are when it comes to housing is the ratio of median home price to median household income.

This graph is striking. Someone earning the median income in 1980 could buy a median house for around 3.5 times their annual income, while in 2022 someone earning the median income would need nearly 6 times their annual income to afford a median priced house.

Does this graph tell the whole story, though? Does house prices versus income really indicate how affordable a house is? After all, the sticker price of a house is only one factor affecting affordability, the other major factor is your mortgage rate. The 1980s were notorious for having mortgage interest rates in the double digits while mortgage interest rates in 2021 neared historic lows approaching 3%. If people are mostly worried about being able to afford housing, not the overall cost of the house, could it be the case that houses were actually more affordable in 2021 than they were in 1980, on cost per month as a fraction of income basis?

### Median Monthly Payment vs. Median Monthly Income

Using the average 30-year mortgage rate per year and using that to calculate the expected monthly payment for a median house, we can answer the question of whether housing has actually become less affordable, as a fraction of income.

This graph tells a slightly different story. While the house prices were considerably lower in the early 1980s, the wild interest rates made them considerably less affordable than they are now. Someone purchasing a median home would have to spend nearly 60% of a median income on mortgage payments per month, while someone purchasing a median home in 2020 would spend only around 25% of a median income on mortgage payments.
