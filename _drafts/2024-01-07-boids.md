One of the things I love about natural systems is how complex behavior can arise from sets of simple rules. In biology you see this fairly often, for example [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) predict predator-prey interactions and can lead to very complex outcomes despite being incredibly simple. A famous example from the history of computer science is John Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) which produces incredibly complex (and sometimes unpredictable) interactions between *cellular automata* from only four rules. A lesser known example are [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), or bird-oid objects, which demonstrate how three principles, *separation*, *alignment*, and *cohesion* can explain how flocking behavior can arise despite decentralized control. I implemented my own version of the Boids algorithm in Typescript using the HTML5 Canvas element to demonstrate flocking behavior, as well as a demo you can play with to see how the various elements affect flocking behavior.
