Hi. I am Harry Ganz. I have been working professionally as a Software Developer since 2013 and created this website as a way of collecting some of my personal projects and share some of the things that I have learned about software development and data modeling with others. 

If you want to look at other projects that I didn't want to share here, you can look at my [github account](https://github.com/harryganz).
