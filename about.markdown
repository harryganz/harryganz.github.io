Hi. I am Harry Ganz. I am a software developer living in the Northeast U.S. I created this website as a way of collecting some of my personal projects and to share some of the things that I have learned about software development and data modeling with others.

If you want to look at some of his projects that I might not want to post on this website, take a look at his [github account](https://github.com/harryganz).
