Harry Ganz is a Software Developer living in the Northeast U.S. Before working in Software, he worked as a Scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration, studying reef fish species in South Florida. He still enjoys using R to answer practical questions, like how much he can expect to pay for a house. Sometimes, he finds time to be a DM for a D&D group, and also likes SCUBA diving and fishing. Most of his time, though, is spent taking care of family. 

If you want to look at some of his projects that he might not want to post on this website, take a look at his [github account](https://github.com/harryganz).
